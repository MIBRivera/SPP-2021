@article{Berti2005,
abstract = {We investigate the effect of spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings on the estimation of parameters for inspiralling compact binaries of massive black holes, and for neutron stars inspiralling into intermediatemass black holes, using hypothetical data from the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We work both in Einstein's theory and in alternative theories of gravity of the scalar-tensor and massivegraviton types. We restrict the analysis to nonprecessing spinning binaries, i.e. to cases where the spins are aligned normal to the orbital plane. We find that the accuracy with which intrinsic binary parameters such as chirp mass and reduced mass can be estimated within general relativity is degraded by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. We find that the bound on the coupling parameter $\omega$<inf>BD</inf> of scalar-tensor gravity is significantly reduced by the presence of spin couplings, while the reduction in the graviton-mass bound is milder. Using fast Monte Carlo simulations of 10<sup>4</sup> binaries, we show that inclusion of spin terms in massive black-hole binaries has little effect on the angular resolution or on distance determination accuracy. For stellar-mass inspirals into intermediate-mass black holes, the angular resolution and the distance are determined only poorly, in all cases considered. We also show that, if LISA's low-frequency noise sensitivity can be extrapolated from 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz to as low as 10<sup>-5</sup> Hz, the accuracy of determining both extrinsic parameters (distance, sky location) and intrinsic parameters (chirp mass, reduced mass) of massive binaries may be greatly improved. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Kocsis2011,
abstract = {We examine the electromagnetic and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of stellar-mass compact objects (COs) spiraling into a supermassive black hole (extreme mass-ratio inspirals), embedded in a thin, radiation-pressure dominated, accretion disk. At large separations, the tidal effect of the secondary CO clears a gap. We derive the conditions necessary for gap opening in a radiation-pressure dominated disk and show that the gap refills during the late GW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden electromagnetic brightening of the source. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular momentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due to accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an analytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body approach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant perturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto the CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the perturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 rad per year, detectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna at high significance. The perturbation is significant for disk models with an effective viscosity proportional to gas pressure but much less so if proportional to the total pressure. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary phase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend different from post-Newtonian vacuum corrections. Our results suggest that observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals may place new sensitive constraints on the physics of accretion disks. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {To enable detection and maximise the physics output of gravitational wave observations from compact binary systems, it is crucial the availability of accurate waveform models. The present work aims at giving an overview for non-experts of the (inspiral) waveforms used in the gravitational wave data analysis for compact binary coalescence. We first provide the essential elements of gravitational radiation physics within a simple Newtonian orbital dynamics and the linearized gravity theory, describing the adiabatic approximation applied to binary systems: the key element to construct the theoretical gravitational waveforms in practice. We next lay out the gravitational waveforms in the post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, and highlight the basic input for the inspiral waveform of the slowly evolving, spinning, nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes, namely, post-Newtonian energy, fluxes and the (absorption-corrected) balance equation. The post-Newtonian inspiral templates are then presented both in the time and frequency domain. Finally, including the merger and subsequent ringdown phase, we briefly survey the two families of the full waveform models of compact binary mergers currently implemented in LSC Algorithm Library Simulation: the effective-one-body approach and the phenomenological frequency domain model.},

In this paper, we investigate the ability of gravitational-wave detectors to constrain the nature of the environment in which compact binaries merge. Methods. We parametrized a variety of environmental effects by modifying the phase of the gravitational signal emitted by black hole and neutron star binaries. We infer the bounds on such effects by current and future generations of interferometers, studying their dependence on the binary's parameters. Results. We show that the strong dephasing induced by accretion and dynamical friction can constrain the density of the surrounding medium to orders of magnitude below those of accretion disks. Planned detectors, such as LISA or DECIGO, will be able to probe densities typical of those of dark matter.},

@article{Vallisneri2008,
abstract = {The Fisher-matrix formalism is used routinely in the literature on gravitational-wave detection to characterize the parameter-estimation performance of gravitational-wave measurements, given parametrized models of the waveforms, and assuming detector noise of known colored Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, the Fisher matrix can be a poor predictor of the amount of information obtained from typical observations, especially for waveforms with several parameters and relatively low expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or for waveforms depending weakly on one or more parameters, when their priors are not taken into proper consideration. In this paper I discuss these pitfalls; show how they occur, even for relatively strong signals, with a commonly used template family for binary-inspiral waveforms; and describe practical recipes to recognize them and cope with them. Specifically, I answer the following questions: (i) What is the significance of (quasi-)singular Fisher matrices, and how must we deal with them? (ii) When is it necessary to take into account prior probability distributions for the source parameters? (iii) When is the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to believe the Fisher-matrix result? In addition, I provide general expressions for the higher-order, beyond-Fisher-matrix terms in the 1/SNR expansions for the expected parameter accuracies. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The upcoming detection of gravitational waves by terrestrial interferometers will usher in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. This will be particularly true when space-based detectors will come of age and measure the mass and spin of massive black holes with exquisite precision and up to very high redshifts, thus allowing for better understanding of the symbiotic evolution of black holes with galaxies, and for high-precision tests of General Relativity in strong-field, highly dynamical regimes. Such ambitious goals require that astrophysical environmental pollution of gravitational-wave signals be constrained to negligible levels, so that neither detection nor estimation of the source parameters are significantly affected. Here, we consider the main sources for space-based detectors - the inspiral, merger and ringdown of massive black-hole binaries and extreme mass-ratio inspirals - and account for various effects on their gravitational waveforms, including electromagnetic fields, cosmological evolution, accretion disks, dark matter, "firewalls" and possible deviations from General Relativity. We discover that the black-hole quasinormal modes are sharply different in the presence of matter, but the ringdown signal observed by interferometers is typically unaffected. The effect of accretion disks and dark matter depends critically on their geometry and density profile, but is negligible for most sources, except for few special extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Electromagnetic fields and cosmological effects are always negligible. We finally explore the implications of our findings for proposed tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves, and conclude that environmental effects will not prevent the development of precision gravitational-wave astronomy.},

@article{Ohme2013,
abstract = {Identifying the source parameters from a gravitational-wave measurement alone is limited by our ability to discriminate signals from different sources and the accuracy of the waveform family employed in the search. Here we address both issues in the framework of an adapted coordinate system that allows for linear Fisher-matrix-type calculations of waveform differences that are both accurate and computationally very efficient. We investigate statistical errors by using principal component analysis of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion coefficients, which is well conditioned despite the Fisher matrix becoming ill conditioned for larger numbers of parameters. We identify which combinations of physical parameters are most effectively measured by gravitational-wave detectors for systems of neutron stars and black holes with aligned spin. We confirm the expectation that the dominant parameter of the inspiral waveform is the chirp mass. The next dominant parameter depends on a combination of the spin and the symmetric mass ratio. In addition, we can study the systematic effect of various spin contributions to the PN phasing within the same parametrization, showing that the inclusion of spin-orbit corrections up to next-to-leading order, but not necessarily of spin-spin contributions, is crucial for an accurate inspiral waveform model. This understanding of the waveform structure throughout the parameter space is important to set up an efficient search strategy and correctly interpret future gravitational-wave observations. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},
