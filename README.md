## Title: Probing the parameter constraints on astrophysical environments of IMRI and EMRI binaries with LISA
### Authors: Marco Immanuel Rivera and Reinabelle Reyes

Codes, graphics, and TeX files for SPP 2021 submission. Big thanks to Andrea Maselli for generously providing code that would be the basis for this work.
Much of our work is derived from their work, [Constraints on the astrophysical environment of binaries with gravitational-wave observations](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202037654)

This work studies the parameter space of environmentally-dephased waveforms and their dependence on the primary mass. We also include the accumulation of the SNR of the waveform difference over time for LISA.

We also acknowledge the help of Ian Vega, Adrian Villanueva, Bence Kocsis, Nico Yunes, and Abraham Loeb for the healthy discussion.
